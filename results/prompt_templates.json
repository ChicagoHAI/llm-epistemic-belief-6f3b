    "example": "I need you to classify the type of belief described in the following scenario.\n\n**Definitions:**\n\n**Epistemic Belief**: A belief that represents a claim about what is true, what exists, or what is likely. These beliefs are \"truth-apt\" - they can be true or false. They aim to track or represent reality. Examples include factual claims, causal claims, and scientific beliefs.\n\n**Non-Epistemic Belief**: A belief that expresses a preference, value, commitment, or pragmatic stance rather than a factual claim. These include personal preferences, moral commitments, aesthetic values, and practical orientations. They are not primarily about what is true, but about what one values, prefers, or is committed to.\n\n**Scenario:**\nExample scenario text\n\n**Task:**\nClassify this belief as either \"epistemic\" or \"non-epistemic\" based on the definitions above.\n\nProvide your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"classification\": \"epistemic\" or \"non-epistemic\",\n  \"confidence\": \"high\", \"medium\", or \"low\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of why you chose this classification\"\n}\n\nRespond only with the JSON, no additional text."
